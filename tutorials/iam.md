AWS Identity & Access Management (IAM)
====

IAM allows you to create credentials for third parties accessing your S3 account with permission constraints.

## Console

You can manage IAM users using the [AWS Console](https://console.aws.amazon.com/iam/home).

## IAM Tools Setup

1. Download the [IAM Command Line Toolkit](https://awscli.amazonaws.com/v2/documentation/api/latest/reference/iam/index.html). Unzip the download and move the folder `IAMCli-1.2.0` into the `bin` folder in your user home directory.
1. In a Terminal.app window, set the home environment for IAM
    ```
    echo 'export JAVA_HOME=`/usr/libexec/java_home`' >> ~/.bash_profile
    echo 'export AWS_IAM_HOME=~/bin/IAMCli-1.2.0' >> ~/.bash_profile
    ```
1. Set the environment variable to point to the credentials file.
    ```
    echo 'export AWS_CREDENTIAL_FILE=$AWS_IAM_HOME/aws-credential.template' >> ~/.bash_profile
    ```
1. Add the path to the IAM programs to your path
    ```
    echo 'export PATH=$AWS_IAM_HOME/bin:$PATH' >> ~/.bash_profile
    ```
1. Update the environment of the current shell (alternatively open a new Terminal.app window).
    ```
    . ~/.bash_profile
    ```
1. Edit the credentials file `aws-credential.template` with your AWS identifiers.

## Create a new IAM User

Add a new IAM user and generate the access credentials. This will print out the *Access Key ID* and *Secret Access Key* to use when logging in with Cyberduck.

```
iam-usercreate -u <username>;iam-useraddkey -u <username>
```

## Attach a Policy

Add a new policy for the user. This example gives the user access to all of your S3 resources.

```
iam-useraddpolicy  -u <username> -e Allow -a s3:* -r arn:aws:s3:::* -o -p `uuidgen`
```

### Restrict Access to a Specific Bucket

- Allow user to list contents of the bucket.
```
iam-useraddpolicy  -u <username> -e Allow -a s3:ListBucket -r arn:aws:s3:::bucketname -o -p `uuidgen`
```
- Allow users to download files in the bucket.
```
iam-useraddpolicy  -u <username> -e Allow -a s3:GetObject -r arn:aws:s3:::bucketname/* -o -p `uuidgen`
```

## Connecting

When you only have access to a specific bucket in the AWS account and don't have the permission to list all buckets, make sure to put `bucketname.s3.amazonaws.com` in the *Server* field of the bookmark.
