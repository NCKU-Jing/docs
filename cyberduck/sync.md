Synchronize Folders
====

## Synchronization

Files can be synchronized by selecting the directory to synchronize in the browser and select *File → Synchronize*. You will be prompted to select the directory on your computer to synchronize the files with.

:::{important}
The options in *Preferences → Transfers → Timestamps* must be enabled.
:::

The criteria to download or upload a file are given by

- the modification date of the files and if available
- the MD5 checksum of the file (for [S3](../protocols/s3/index.md), [Azure](../protocols/azure.md), and [CloudFiles](../protocols/openstack/cloudfiles.md))

You will be prompted to confirm the actions and if missing files should only be downloaded, uploaded, or mirrored.

:::

- **Checkbox:** Toggle to include or exclude files or directories from the transfer.
- **Down Arrow:** The file is downloaded from the server replacing the local file if included.
- **Up Arrow:** The file is uploaded to the server replacing the remote file if included.
- **Plus Sign:** The file does not exist and will be newly created when transferred.

### Mirror Files

Files are transferred in both directions and created if missing or replaced with the newer file on either system depending on the timestamp.

### Only Download Files

Files are downloaded that match one of the following criteria:

- Do not exist on the local filesystem
- Have a different checksum
- Have a newer timestamp on the server

No files are uploaded.

### Only Upload Files

Files are uploaded that match one of the following criteria:

- Do not exist on the server
- Have a different checksum
- Have a newer timestamp on the local filesystem

No files are downloaded.

## Other Solutions

You have to manually restart the synchronization in the transfer window. If you want to automate things you will be better off with either

- [Cyberduck CLI](https://duck.sh/) which allows you to write a script and schedule it with your preferred method such as `cron`.
- [Mountain Duck](https://mountainduck.io/) which allows you to mount the remote volume and synchronise files with any of your preferred tools such as `rsync`.
