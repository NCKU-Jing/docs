## Using Drag & Drop

Note that dragging files is not limited to the *Finder.app*, but also works i.e. with attachments *Mail.app* or any other application supporting file promises.

### Drag to a Folder

Drag the file from the *Finder.app* or *Windows Explorer* to the [browser](browser.md) window to upload to the current working directory or the folder hovered over.

### Drag to a Bookmark

Upload files without first opening a connection to a server by dropping the file(s) onto a [bookmark](bookmarks.md) item in the bookmark source list.

### Local Disk Browser

You can browse your local hard disk within Cyberduck and drag files to the remote browser opened in another window or tab.

## Preferences

### Transfers → General → Uploads → Upload with temporary filename

An option to upload with a temporary name and rename the file after the transfer is complete. An upload that is not complete, will not be renamed. This is useful for uploading to watch folders, that should only pick up a file once the upload is complete. To specify a different temporary filename pattern, use the [hidden configuration option](../tutorials/hidden_properties.md)

```
queue.upload.file.temporary.format="'{0}-{1}'"
```

where `{0}` is the original filename and `{1}` is a random UUID. The default setting uses a temporary filename of `filename-uuid`.
