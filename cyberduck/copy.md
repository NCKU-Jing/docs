Open two browser windows each with a connection to any server and drag files and folders between the browsers to copy files or using *Edit → Copy* followed by *Edit → Paste*.

## Copy Files and Folders Between Servers

### Copying Files Directly on the Server

This is supported for the following protocols

- [Azure](../protocols/azure.md)
- [OpenStack Swift](../protocols/openstack/index.md)
- [WebDAV](../protocols/webdav/index.md)
- [Amazon S3](../protocols/s3/index.md)
- [iRODS](../protocols/irods.md)

### Copying Files Using Download and Upload

[FTP](../protocols/ftp.md) and [SFTP](../protocols/sftp/index.md) do not support a copy operation. 

:::{important}
Transfer speed depends on your local connectivity as files are routed through your computer for transfer between the remote servers.
