### List and Outline View

::::{tabs}
:::{group-tab} macOS

Select *View → as List (`⌘1`)* or *View → as Outline (`⌘2`)* for expandable folders. You can expand and collapse folders using the right and left arrow keys in the outline view.

Navigate into a folder with a double-click *(`⌘↓`)* or one level up by using the ▲ button next to the path-field *(`⌘↑`)*.

:::
:::{group-tab} Windows

You can expand and collapse folders using the right and left arrow keys in the outline view.

Navigate into a folder with a doubl-click *(`Ctrl+Down`)* or one level up by using the ▲ button next to the path-field *(`Ctrl+Up`)*.

:::

### Tabs

:::{admonition} macOS only
:class: tip

Enable tabs by default when choosing *File → New Browser (`⌘N`)* by selecting in System Preferences the checkbox *Dock → Prefer tabs when opening documents: Always*. New browser windows and the transfer window will then be displayed in a single window frame with a tab bar. You can merge windows with *View → Show Tab Bar and Window → Merge all Windows*
:::

### Spring-Loaded Folders

Spring-loaded folders are a feature that allows you to move a file or even another folder, into a folder deeply nested within several other folders using drag and drop. To enable, choose *Preferences → Browser → Use spring-loaded folders when dragging files* and adjust the delay for the folder to expand when hovering over with the mouse. Note that spring-loaded folders are only supported in the outline view.

### Filter and Search

Use the search field (macOS `⌘/` Windows `Ctrl+F`) to display only files that match the search string in the browser. To search recursively, hit the return key (`⏎`). Only files matching the search or folders with containing files matching the pattern will be displayed in the browser.

:::{note}
Search is case-insensitive and does look for matching sequences in the filename supporting glob patterns `*` and `?`.
:::

The following protocols have a server-side index that is used to give fast results without recursively descending into folders.

- [Google Drive](../protocols/googledrive.md)
- [Dropbox](../protocols/dropbox.md)
- [Amazon S3](../protocols/s3/index.md)
- [Backblaze B2](../protocols/b2.md)
- [Microsoft OneDrive](../protocols/onedrive.md)

:::{tip}
You can also search for files by _Version_ where applicable.
:::

#### Supported Wildcards

| Wildcard | Description | Example | Matches |
| -------- | :---: | :---: | :---: |
| `*` |matches any number of any characters including none | Te* | Test, Tee, or Termin |
| `?` | matches any single character | ?bc | Abc, abc, or lbc |

### Sorting

You can sort the file listing by clicking the table column header. Choose *View → Column* to add more headers such as *Kind* to allow sorting by file type including folders appearing first in the list.

### Local Disk File Browser

Choose your computer name from the protocol selection popup button in the *New Connection* window.

Alternatively, you can use drag and drop or Menu *File → Upload (macOS `⌥↑` Windows `Alt+Up`)*. You can also copy *(macOS `⌘C` Windows `Ctrl+C`)* files in your file browser and paste them into Cyberduck using Menu *Edit → Paste (macOS `⌘V` Windows `Ctrl+V`)* afterward.

See other [upload](upload.md) methods.

## Working with Files and Folders

### Edit

You can edit any file on the server using your preferred application. See [Edit Files](edit.md).

### Create new Folder or File

Use *File → New Folder... (macOS `⇧⌘N` Windows `Ctrl+Shift+N`)* or *File → New File... (macOS `⌘F` Windows `Ctrl+Shift+F`)* to create a new folder or file on the server.

### Move or Duplicate Files and Folders

You can move files in the browser as you would in the *Finder.app/ Explorer* using drag and drop. Use the `⌥` modifier key on macOS or the Ctrl key on Windows to duplicate files. If connected to the same server, you can also move files between different browser windows.

The following protocols allow duplicating files on the server without downloading and uploading but copying in place:

- [S3](../protocols/s3/index.md)
- [WebDAV](../protocols/webdav/index.md)
- [Azure](../protocols/azure.md)
- [Dropbox](../protocols/dropbox.md)

To move a file, use *Edit → Cut (macOS `⌘X` Windows `Ctrl+X`)* followed by *Edit → Paste (macOS `⌘V` Windows `Ctrl+V`)*. To duplicate a file, use *Edit → Copy (macOS `⌘C` Windows `Ctrl+C`)* followed by *Edit → Paste (macOS `⌘V` Windows `Ctrl+V`)*.

The following protocols support server-sided copying without intermediate downloads:

- [OpenStack Swift](../protocols/openstack/index.md)
- [OneDrive](../protocols/onedrive.md)
- [Sharepoint](../protocols/sharepoint.md)
- [Google Drive](../protocols/googledrive.md)
- [Google Cloud Storage](../protocols/googlecloudstorage.md)
- [Files.com](../protocols/files.com.md)
- [Box](../protocols/box.md)
- [Backblaze B2](../protocols/b2.md)

### Copy Files and Folders to Different Server

You can copy files between arbitrary servers when connected to with two open browser windows. Drag files from one browser to the other to transfer files between servers.

### Rename a File or Folder

Select the file in the browser and press the *Return key*. Type the new name and press *Return* again to exit the editing mode. You can also rename files by choosing *File → Info (macOS `⌘I` Windows `Alt+Return`)* or press the *Get [Info](info.md)* toolbar button. Simply enter the new name in the very top field. The field must lose focus (e.g. by hitting Return or Tab) to commit the filename change.

### Deleting Files and Folders

Some protocols support the trashing of files instead of permanently deleting them.  This feature is enabled by default. It can be disabled using a [hidden configuration option](../tutorials/hidden_properties.md).

```
browser.delete.trash=false
```

This is supported for the following protocols: 
- [Google Drive](../protocols/googledrive.md)

### Create a Symbolic Link

Choose *File → New Symbolic Link...* to create a symbolic link. This is supported on UNIX systems with a [SFTP](../protocols/sftp/index.md) connection and some [FTP](../protocols/ftp.md) with `SITE SYMLINK` extension.

### Info Window

Select the file in the browser and choose *File → Info (macOS `⌘I` Windows `Alt+Return`) to display [detailed attributes](info.md)* of a file in a tool window. It allows to change permissions, manage content distributions for cloud services, and settings specific to the [Amazon S3](../protocols/s3/index.md) service.

### Quick Look

::::{admonition} macOS only
:class: tip

You can toggle Quick Look in a Cyberduck browser for any file using *Space Bar*. A preview is rendered depending on a Quick Look Plugin available on your system for the given file type. Many file types like different image formats can be previewed with the bundled plugins in OS X and HTML is even rendered in the Quick Look preview panel.

## Problems

### Special Characters Such as Umlaute

If characters aren't displayed correctly in the browser, try to change the character encoding used. See *View → Text Encoding* or edit the [bookmark](bookmarks.md#edit-bookmark) *Encoding* setting. Try `UTF-8` (the default), `ISO-8859-1`, and `Windows-1252`.

### The Folder Size isn't Displayed Correctly

This is not the size of its content but the size of the folder itself. Use *File → Info (macOS `⌘I` Windows `Alt+Return`)* to [calculate the size](info.md#calculate-folder-size) of all contained files recursively.

## Preferences

### General → Browser → Save Workspace

Restore browser sessions that were left open when the application was last closed.

### Browser → Browser → Open new browser window on startup

Open new browser window after application launch.

### Browser → General 

#### Browser → General → Show Hidden Files

#### Browser → General → Double click opens file in external editor
Open files in a external editor by double-clicking

#### Browser → General → Return key selects folder or file to rename
Use ⏎ key to select a file or folder for renaming 

#### Browser → General → Info window always shows current selection

Use only one *Info* window which updates with the selection change in the browser. If unchecked, open multiple Info windows to compare files.

## Hidden Preferences

### Adjust the Browser Font Size

A [hidden configuration option](../tutorials/hidden_properties.md).

```
browser.font.size=18
```

### Duplicate Filename Format

A [hidden configuration option](../tutorials/hidden_properties.md). Define a different format using 

```
browser.duplicate.format="{0} ({1}){2}"
```

where the plaseholders will be replaced with

- {0} with the base filename
- {1} with the timestampof the file
- {2} with the extension in the format `.extension` if present in the original filename.

### Warning Before Renaming or Moving Files

A [hidden configuration option](../tutorials/hidden_properties.md). A confirmation is shown before renaming or moving files.

```
browser.move.confirm=true
```

### Re-Enable File Listing Limit Prompt

A [hidden configuration option](../tutorials/hidden_properties.md) can re-enable the file listing limit prompt after dismissing it with enabled *Always* checkbox.

::::{tabs}
:::{group-tab} macOS

Open *Terminal.app* and execute the command

```
defaults delete ch.sudo.cyberduck browser.list.limit.directory
```

and the command

```
defaults delete ch.sudo.cyberduck browser.list.limit.container
```
