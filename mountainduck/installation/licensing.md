Mountain Duck is licensed on a per-seat basis. Each license is valid for one user. The license can be used on multiple devices as long as the same user is accessing the application.

Licenses are registered to the email address in use while purchasing. Buying more than one seat using the same email address, you will receive a single multi-user license file meant to be used for all users.

## Known Issues

### No License File Received

:::{tip}
Installations from the Mac App Store do not require a license file.
:::

Additional reasons for a missing license file can be:
- A key is sent when the payment is no more pending.
- The license file will be sent to the registered email. Typos can misslead the email.
- Check the spam folder of your email application.

### Not a Valid Registration Key

Your license file is valid for an older version of Mountain Duck. Please upgrade your license file to use the latest version of the application or revert to an older version.

An additional reason might be, that your email application changed the license file while downloading. Make sure that the filename of the registration key ends with `.mountainducklicense`. In this case please try the following:
- If you are using a webmail provider, try using a different browser or email client application to access your mail.
- Contact you hosting service provider how to download attachments.
- Forward the mail to a different mail account where you possibly donâ€™t have an issue downloading attachments.
- Change the file extension of the license file back to `.mountainducklicense`.

### Recover License Files

Registration keys can be [recovered](https://mountainduck.io/help/) using the email address you registered while purchasing.
