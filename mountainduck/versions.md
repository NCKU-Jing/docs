File Versions
====

:::{note}
Mountain Duck 4.12 or later required. Previously versions could be accessed from the [context menu](interface.md#context-menu-in-finder-and-windows-file-explorer) by right-clicking on a file in *Finder* on macOS or *File Explorer* on Windows and choosing *Versions*.
:::

A list of file versions can be viewed within the *Versions* tab of the *[Info](../cyberduck/info.md#versions)* window. The files can also be reverted to a chosen version of the list.

## Supported Protocols

The versions feature within the *Info* window is supported for the following protocols:

| **Protocol** | **Revert previous version** | **Open/Quick Look previous version** | **Delete version** |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
