## Connecting to Windows Azure Blob Storage

### Hostname

Edit the hostname to connect to your account in the format `<account>.blob.core.windows.net`.

:::{warning}
Azure Files Storage is not supported.
:::

### Credentials

#### Account and Key

You must obtain the login credentials (Account Name and Primary Access Key) from [portal.azure.com](https://portal.azure.com/). You can find the keys in the section *Access keys*. In the login prompt of Cyberduck upon connecting to Windows Azure you enter the *Storage Account Name* for the username and *Primary Access Key* for the password.

#### Shared Access Signatures (SAS)

You can use a [SAS](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/storage/common/storage-sas-overview) when you want to provide access to resources in your storage account to any client not possessing your storage account's access keys.

- [Download](https://profiles.cyberduck.io/Azure%20(Shared%20Access%20Signature%20Token).cyberduckprofile) the Azure (Shared Access Signature Token) profile or install it from *Preferences… → Profiles*.

### Cyberduck CLI

You can list all containers with [Cyberduck CLI](https://duck.sh/) using

```
duck --username <storageaccount> --list azure://<storageaccount>.blob.core.windows.net/`
```

For a storage account named `kahy9boj3eib` that would be 

```
duck --username kahy9boj3eib --list azure://kahy9boj3eib.blob.core.windows.net/
```

Refer to the [Cyberduck CLI](../cli/index.md) documentation for more operations.

## Access Control (ACL)

You can edit ACLs in *File → Info (macOS `⌘I` Windows `Alt+Return`) → Permissions*. To make objects in a container publicly accessible, choose *Everyone → READ*. Note that this applies to all files in a container.

## Containers

To create a new container in your account, browse to the root and choose *File → New Folder... (macOS `⇧⌘N` Windows `Ctrl+Shift+N`)*.

## Blob Type

Uploads are stored as append blob type by default. You can use the [hidden configuration option](../cyberduck/preferences.md#hidden-configuration-options) `azure.upload.blobtype` which allows the values `BLOCK_BLOB`, `PAGE_BLOB` and `APPEND_BLOB`.

## Metadata

You can edit standard custom metadata. Choose *File → Info → Metadata* to edit custom headers.

### Default Metadata

Currently only possible using a [hidden configuration option](../cyberduck/preferences.md#hidden-configuration-options) you can define default headers to be added for uploads. Multiple headers must be separated using a whitespace delimiter. Key and value of a header are separated with `=`. For example, if you want to add an HTTP header for `Cache-Control` and one named `Creator` you would set

```
defaults write ch.sudo.cyberduck azure.metadata.default "Cache-Control=public,max-age=86400 Creator=Cyberduck"
```

### Shared Access Signature URLs

A private object stored in Azure Storage can be made publicly available for a limited time using a signed URL. The signed URL can be used by anyone to download the object, yet it includes a date and time after which the URL will no longer work. Copy the signed URL from *Edit → Copy URL→ Signed URL*.

:::{note}
Currently only signed URLs with a validity of 24 hours are available.
:::

### Access Logs

Configure access logging for buckets in the *Info* panel.

## Limitations

- Container and blob [naming conventions](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/rest/api/storageservices/Naming-and-Referencing-Containers--Blobs--and-Metadata).
- [CDN configuration](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/cdn/cdn-create-new-endpoint) is currently only possible using the web interface.

## Problems

### One of the Request Inputs is out of Range

Please follow the [Naming and Referencing Containers, Blobs, and Metadata](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/rest/api/storageservices/Naming-and-Referencing-Containers--Blobs--and-Metadata) guidelines.
