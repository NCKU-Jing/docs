iRODS (Integrated Rule-Oriented Data System)
====

> The Integrated Rule-Oriented Data System (iRODS) is an open-source data management software used by research organizations and government agencies worldwide.

:::{admonition} iRODS ...
:class: tip

- ... enables data discovery using a metadata catalog that describes every file, every directory, and every storage resource in the data grid.
- ... automates data workflows, with a rule engine that permits any action to be initiated by any trigger on any server or client in the grid.
- ... enables secure collaboration, so users only need to log in to their home grid to access data hosted on a remote grid.
- ... implement data virtualization, allowing access to distributed storage assets under a unified namespace, and freeing organizations from getting locked into single-vendor storage solutions.

## Connecting

Download the corresponding *Connection Profile* for preconfigured settings and double-click on it to install it. Choose the profile from the list of protocols when editing a [bookmark](../cyberduck/bookmarks.md) or use the `<vendor>:/` scheme when using the [CLI](../cli/index).

:::{note}
Connection profiles can be installed from *Preferences â†’ Profiles*.
:::

### Provider

- [CyVerse Data Store](http://www.cyverse.org/data-store) (Formerly iPlant Collaborative) - {download}`Connection Profile<https://profiles.cyberduck.io/iRODS%20(iPlant%20Collaborative).cyberduckprofile>`
- RENCI - {download}`Connection Profile<https://profiles.cyberduck.io/iRODS%20(RENCI).cyberduckprofile>`
- TACC - {download}`Connection Profile<https://profiles.cyberduck.io/iRODS%20(TACC).cyberduckprofile>`

### Authentication

#### Authentication With Native Scheme

This is the default with no additional configuration required.

#### Authentication With PAM Scheme

To authenticate with PAM, prefix the username with PAM:or set it in the [connection profile](index.md#connection-profiles) using as

```
      <key>Authorization</key>
      <string>PAM</string>
```

### Resource Server

You can specify a non-default resource server in the Region key of the [connection profile](index.md#connection-profiles) using a colon-separated syntax (Issue [#8721](https://github.com/iterate-ch/cyberduck/issues/8721)) such as

```
   	<key>Region</key>
   	<string>iplant:storageresourcename</string>
```

## Transfers

### Use Parallel Connections

If [multiple connections](../cyberduck/transfer.md#connections) are configured by default in *Preferences* or set in the bookmark options with *Transfer Files: Open multiple connections*, get and put transfers to the data store use parallel concurrent connections.

The number of parallel connections is controlled using the lower right stepper control in the [Transfers](../cyberduck/transfer.md) window.
