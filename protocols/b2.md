> [Backblaze B2 Cloud Storage](https://www.backblaze.com/b2/cloud-storage.html) works similar to Amazon S3 or Microsoft Azure, allowing you to store unlimited data in the cloud. But does it for 1/4th the cost.

## Connecting

Obtain the login credentials from [backblaze.com](https://secure.backblaze.com/). Choose App Keys on the sidebar and generate a new application key. Once you have your credentials, choose B2 Cloud Storage from the list of protocols when editing a [bookmark](../cyberduck/bookmarks.md) or use the `b2://` scheme when using the [CLI](../cli/index.md).

### Authenticating Using Master Key

- The Master Application Key for an account can be found at the top of the *App Keys* page of the Backblaze website once you [signed in](https://secure.backblaze.com/user_signin.htm?netid=1624013329972).
- The key for your account has complete access but will become invalid if you generate a new one.
- The key information is only shown when generating the key and is not shown again, so make sure you save the credentials in a secure location if you plan on using this more than once.

Use your `Account ID` and `Master Application Key` to log in.

### Authenticating Using Application Key

Use your `Key ID` and `Application Key` to log in. The application key can be restricted to a single bucket.

#### How to Create Application Keys

1. Use the Backblaze website and [sign in](https://secure.backblaze.com/user_signin.htm?netid=1624013329972) to your account
2. Click on *App Keys* in the left-hand menu
3. Select *Add a New Application Key*
4. Specify the key settings and permissions and click on *Create New Key*
5. After the Application Key is created, a blue panel is displayed containing the `Key ID` and `Application Key` for the newly generated key.

:::{important}
The key information will only appear once. Copy the information somewhere safe for later retrieval.

:::{Attention}
Buckets created prior to May 4th, 2020 are not S3 compatible and cannot be accessed
:::

## Cyberduck CLI

You can list all buckets with [Cyberduck CLI](https://duck.sh/) using

```
duck --username <application key> --list b2:/
```

Refer to the [Cyberduck CLI](../cli/index.md) documentation for more operations.

## Features

### Creating Buckets

Choose *File → New Folder* to create a new [bucket](https://www.backblaze.com/b2/docs/buckets.html) in the root of the browser.

[Bucket names](https://help.backblaze.com/hc/en-us/articles/217666908-What-you-need-to-know-about-B2-Bucket-names), notably:

- must be between 6 and 50 characters long;
- can only consist of alphanumeric characters or "-";
- are case insensitive;
- are globally uniques (i.e. across all Backblaze accounts);
- cannot begin with "b2-" (reserved for Backblaze use).

![Create a Bucket](_images/B2_Bucket_Type.png)

#### Private

Setting it to `allPrivate` means that every download requires an authorization token.

#### Public

Setting it to `allPublic` means that everybody is allowed to download the files in the bucket.

### File Versioning

You can view all revisions of a file in the browser by choosing *View → Show Hidden Files*.

#### Info → Versions

A list of file versions can be viewed in the *Versions* tab of the *[Info](../cyberduck/info.md#versions)* window. Files can be reverted to a chosen version of this list. Additionally, versions of the list can be deleted.

:::{note}
`Bucket Versioning` has to be enabled within the *B2* tab of the *Info* window before the versions of the files are displayed.

### Authorized URL

Create an authorized URL to make files available publicly. Choose *File → Share…*. The shared URL expires in 7 days.

### Large File Uploads

Files larger than `200MB` are split into `100MB` chunks and uploaded with multiple connections. The number of connections used can be limited using the toggle in the lower right of the transfer window.

![Large File Upload](_images/B2_Large_File_Upload.png)

Large uploads can be resumed when interrupted.

#### Unfinished Large Uploads

You can view unfinished large uploads in the browser by choosing *View → Show Hidden Files*.

#### Checksum

If you want to have the SHA1 checksum set in the file info for the large file upload in `large_file_sha1` make sure to check *Preferences → Transfers → Checksum → Uploads → Verify checksum*.

### Edit Bucket Type

New buckets are private by default, meaning that you need a bucket authorization token to download the files. You can allow public access to files by opening the [ACL tab in the *Info* panel](../cyberduck/info.md#access-control-list-acl) and choose *Everyone → Read*.

![Bucket ACL](_images/B2_Bucket_ACL.png)

### Edit Bucket Lifecycle Rules

Specify after how many days a file in a bucket should be hidden or deleted.

### Retries for Failed File Transfers

The number of times a retry attempt is made upon a failure such as `503 Service Unavailable` depends on the setting in *Preferences → Connection → Repeat failed networking tasks → Number of retries*.

## Share

Create download [shares](../cyberduck/share.md#backblaze-b2) of files for people with no access to your bucket using *File → Share...*.

## Known Limitations

### Modification Date

The modification date retention is supported using `src_last_modified_millis` for new files uploaded but without the option to adjust the modification date later.

### Rename and Move Files

<del>not supported.</del> Supported in Cyberduck 7 or later.
