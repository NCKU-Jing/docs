## Connecting

- **Protocol**: `Swift (OpenStack Object Storage)`
- **Server**: `api.van1.auro.io`
- **Port**: `5000`
- **Username**: `<os-tenant-name>:<os-username>`
- **Password**: `<os-password>`

The server name is found in the Cloud Dashboard under `Project/Compute/Access & Security/API Access`. Use the Identity server, not the Object Store server.

The username is a concatenation of your OpenStack tenant name and OpenStack user name. These values can be found in your [OpenStack RC file](https://login.van1.auro.io/project/access_and_security/api_access/openrc/).
