#### Creating S3 Access Using the Control Panel

- Log into your [OVHcloud Control Panel](https://us.ovhcloud.com/manager/).
- Choose a *Standard Object Storage* container from your public cloud project.
- Check the region and install the corresponding connection profile.
- Add an existing user or create a new one.

## Cyberduck CLI

To use a connection, the corresponding profile must be [installed](../../cli/index.md#profiles) with the following parameters using [Cyberduck CLI](https://duck.sh/).

```
duck --username OS_TENANT_ID:OS_USERNAME --password PROJECT_USER_PASSWORD --region BHS3 --list ovh://CONTAINERNAME
```

Alternatively, connect using the default connection profile by specifying the authentication hostname with

```
duck --username OS_TENANT_ID:OS_USERNAME --password PROJECT_USER_PASSWORD --region BHS3 --list swift://auth.cloud.ovh.net/CONTAINERNAME
```

## Containers

You can choose the region when creating a new container with *File → New Folder…*.
